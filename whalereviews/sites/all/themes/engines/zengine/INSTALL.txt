Installation:

   sites/all/themes/engines directory.

2. Download a zengine theme (zenzen - http://drupal.org/project/zenzen 
   or zen_basic - http://drupal.org/project/zen_basic) and copy 
   it to your themes directory as you would for a normal theme. 
   Enable the theme in: Administer -> Site Building -> Themes

3. Make a copy of the theme and use this as the base of your
   zengine-compatible theme.
